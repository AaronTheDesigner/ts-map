# TS Map
small map for typescript practice. uses faker and random generation. 

### extra notes
 * use Definitely Typed to find type declaration files or...
 * look up on npm.org

### FILE STRUCTURE NOTES
 * every class should have it's own file
 * class for user, company, map (Map.ts, User.ts, Company.ts)
 * a file whose primary purpose is to create an export (class) is capitalized.
 * lowercase is often root, or exports plain objects or plain functions.
